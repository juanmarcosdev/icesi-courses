# Interactive Workshop — String Manipulation & Formatting in Python

This is an **interactive workshop** focused on mastering:

- String slicing and stride  
- Case manipulation (`lower`, `upper`, `capitalize`)  
- Splitting and joining strings  
- Stripping whitespace  
- Searching and replacing  
- `str.format()`  
- f-strings  
- Template strings  

The workshop includes guided exercises, live code execution, and examples you can modify and experiment with directly.
